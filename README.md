# The-games
This is the invoation of coding. So far we have bypassed blooket and edpuzzle. With these scripts we will have acess to the console and editing the code on pages in whatver way we want. This will open us up to running games on urls that dont have games. Running code that would be otherwise impossible. We will be working hard to take everything to an automation standard. - Melissa
